## Backends

This directory contains lower level functions. The two folders correspond to native python and C compiled modules. The sources for c files can be found in csource directory.

It is guaranteed that both the backends expose similar functions with same name so that writing wrapper functions is simple

This module is completely independent of outside packages.
